# Neural-Netwok-Project--coursera
Course project on image classifier using deep learning(neural networks) -course Neural Networks and deep learning Coursera
A project on image classification using neural networks.
- Building and Implementing a 2 layer neural network model with 72% accuracy of predicting image using training dataset
- Building and Implementing a 4 layer neural network model with 80% accuracy of predicting image using the same training dataset. Improving accuracy by 8%
- testing the model on user input image and correctly predicting the result
